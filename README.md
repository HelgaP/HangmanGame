# HangmanGame
This is a hangman game where a user can guess a word which is chosen randomly from an array of prepared words.
Only list of words is prepared, definition and synonim (a hint) are fetched through Words API at the beginning of the game.
With every wrong letter, a part of hangman image appears. Game is over when either a word is fully guessed or all attempts are gone.
