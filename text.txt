Questions:
- how to center horizontally a texLabel at a runtime? (It can be of different size based on what was randomly chosen from a dictionary)

What I learnt from building this app:
- button is the only object without autoresizing unlike labels and textfield
- better design app on the smallest size device and make auto resizing. Otherwise, it won't look good on iphone SE or 8
- it's possible to use both swift and objective c files within the same project. But I still haven't practised it
- collection in a db can store only one type of data. One collection for books, one for users, etc
- there is a thing like testing API connection
- "?" is the start of the queryString which contains data to be send to a server from a client. (in my case random=true) But if I want to send a big potion of data to a server, I need to send it via HTTP body and POST method. 
- completion handler: function will call closure when it's done with executing. Basically, it means that completion handlers are executed synchronously? 
- how to read data form text file included in a bundle
- how to separate string into array with a separator
- completion in caller function calls closure/completion handler 
- request is used in datatask when we need to pass some data (in the form oh headers) to a server (like api key)
